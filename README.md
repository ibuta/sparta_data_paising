Problem One

Requirement
To resolve the exercise case: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
The following steps were done and instruction are available to the tester.

Development
Following the requirements there were defined 3 categories. An array with all the possible numbers bellow 1000 and threee methods to check in which category they would fall. When checked with the conditions the results will be pushed to the respectively array a multiple of three, five or five teen. 


Instructions
To resolve the exercises, the tester on the terminal should run the rspec test in order to obtain the results. Alteration of the values can be done on file directly.   


Problem Two

Requirement
To resolve the exercise case: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
The following steps were done and instruction are available to the tester.

Development
The logic behind both, the test method and the resolution, followed the logic of adding an array with values inside and from there adding two numbers (x+num) until 4000000 by using a while loop. In the defined sum method were applied two if statements in which there were two methods apply to check whether they were even or odd numbers. The respective numbers will be added to the array in which the category falls. The rspec was installed in order to check the work.

Instructions
To resolve the exercises, the tester on the terminal should run the rspec test in order to obtain the results. Alteration of the values can be done on file directly.
